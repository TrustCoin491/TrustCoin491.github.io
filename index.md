# Welcome to TrustCoin

TrustCoin aims to democratize governance within digital communities by leveraging blockchain technology. This project introduces a decentralized ERC-20 token that empowers community members to participate actively in decision-making through a transparent and secure voting mechanism.

**Setting Up a Wallet** 
- Purpose: A digital wallet is required to interact with the Ethereum network and to manage your TrustCoin tokens.
- Step-by-Step Guide:
  1. **Download and Install** Download and install MetaMask, a popular Ethereum wallet, from MetaMask.io.
  2. **Create/Import an Account:** Follow the instructions to create a new wallet or import an existing one using your secret recovery phrase.
  3. **Connect to Ethereum Network:** Ensure your MetaMask is set to the Ethereum Mainnet or the respective test network if you are using test tokens.
- **Computer Science Concept:** Digital wallets utilize asymmetric cryptography to secure your assets. Your public key is your address visible to others, while your private key, which must remain confidential, is used to sign transactions, proving ownership of your tokens.
  **Acquiring TrustCoins**
  - **Purpose:** To participate in voting or other contract interactions, you need to have TrustCoin tokens in your wallet.
  - **Step-by-Step Guide:**
      1. **Token Receipt:** Participate in the initial token distribution, purchase from exchanges, or receive tokens from another user.
      1. **Adding Token to MetaMask:**
           - Click 'Add Token' in MetaMask.
           - Enter the TrustCoin contract address (provided on the project’s website).
           - MetaMask will automatically recognize the token and add it to your wallet.
      - **Computer Science Concept:** This process involves the ERC-20 standard interface which defines a common list of rules for Ethereum tokens to follow, ensuring interoperability within the ecosystem.
Participating in Governance
- **Purpose:** Engage with the governance model of TrustCoin by voting on proposals or creating new ones if you are an authorized user.
- **Step-by-Step Guide:**
  1. Viewing Proposals:
     -  Access the project’s dApp or use a blockchain explorer that can interact with smart contracts, like Etherscan
     -  Navigate to the “Governance” section to see active proposals.
  2. **Voting on Proposals:**
     - Select a proposal to view details.
     - Choose to vote for or against the proposal.
     - Confirm your vote via MetaMask, which will record your vote on the blockchain.
  3. **Checking Voting Power:**
     - Your voting power is equivalent to the amount of TrustCoin you hold at the time of voting.
- **Computer Science Concept** Voting employs transaction-based state transitions on the blockchain, where each vote transaction changes the state of a proposal, tracked transparently and immutably.
  Advanced Features
  - **Step-by-Step Guide:**
    1. **Minting New Tokens** (if authorized):
       - Navigate to the “Mint” function in the governance dApp.
       - Enter the recipient’s address and the amount to mint.
       - Confirm the transaction.
