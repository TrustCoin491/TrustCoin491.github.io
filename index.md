Blockchain technology presents a transformative approach to achieving decentralized governance. By integrating blockchain with ERC-20 tokens, TrustCoin provides a robust platform for conducting secure and tamper-proof voting. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that once a vote is recorded, it cannot be altered, enhancing the integrity of the electoral process within digital ecosystems.
