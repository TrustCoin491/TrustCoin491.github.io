<h2 id="community-feedback">Community Feedback</h2>

<p>Here are some recommendations and feedback from our users:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adding clubs issues</strong>: Adding clubs was not working. An error about needing a clubID was given whenever submit was pressed.</li>
  <li><strong>Landing page event card</strong>: The card that linked to events on the landing page would not work if user was not signed in. It was suggested to make events visible to all users, even when not signed in.</li>
  <li><strong>Navbar Profile Image</strong>: It was suggested to only have a profile image appear for logged in users. When not signed in, the dropdown menu should just say “Sign In.”</li>
  <li><strong>Alerts &amp; User Interaction</strong>: There should be a notification when users join clubs to ensure them the command worked.</li>
</ul>
